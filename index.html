</h1>

<p>Final project for CS50 classes, year 2014. Some modifications were added later.
The purpose was to create a web site with units conversion that can work offline. And calculating results all at once as user is typing into one of the fields.
It consists of one javascript driven html page with three blocks of units - Lengths, Weights (or Mass) and Volume.
Each block can be easily extended with new units (currently supporting types are metric and US). The units represented as an object (something like a database) where each unit has some parameters (like system type and definition). Each unit defined with fraction of numbers inside its system type - to get precise conversion results (for example 1 ounce def is 16, 1 lb is 1, 1 stone is 1/14 and so on). Another object contains conversion decimals - it's a computated difference between 'base' units of two systems (for example, 2.20462 for 1 lb to 1 kilo conversion). HTML elements is about to be built from these objects by javascript.
The main chalenge for me was to provide user with an ability to type numbers and get the results immediately, wrong inputs should be ignored. It was achieved by using regular expressions on keypress and input events.</p>
